<h2> My Two Favorite Art Forms</h2>
 <p> 
 What is Digital Illustration?
 
<div class="bordered">
<p> Computer illustration or digital illustration is the use of digital tools to produce images under the direct manipulation of the artist, usually through a pointing device such as a tablet or a mouse. It is distinguished from computer-generated art, which is produced by a computer using mathematical models created by the artist. It is also distinct from digital manipulation of photographs, in that it is an original construction "from scratch". (Photographic elements may be incorporated into such works, but they are not the primary basis or source for them.) </p> </div>

	<p> What Do I Use? </p>
<div class="bordered">

<p> SOFTWARE: </p>

<p> Clip Studio Paint (also marketed as Manga Studio in North America and ComicStudio in Japan) is a family of software applications for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows used for the digital creation of comics and manga, developed by Celsys, a Japanese graphics software company. The current version is sold as "Clip Studio Paint Pro", and "Clip Studio Paint EX", which adds support for multi-page documents and other features.Earlier versions were packaged as "Debut" and "EX" varieties. </p></div>

<p> DRAWING PEN AND DISPLAY:</p> 

<p> Like a lot of just starting digital artist I did not have the funding for a bif name brand graphics tablet. So I bought a Huion.And to my surprise it was an amazing tool.</p>

<p> Huion is a a trade mark of 'Shenzhen Huion Animation Technology Co., LTD chinese company headquartered in ShenZhen, China, that specializes in graphics tablets and related products. In 2010 Huion obtained CE,FCC,and CCC recognition.1

Huion tablets are notable for their use of a cordless, pressure-sensitive digital pen with rechargeable battery (800 hours). In addition to manufacturing and selling tablets, Huion also manufactures graphical digitizing monitors with input technology compatible with interactive tablet Operating systems like Windows.</p>

<p> Traditional Art?</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p>

The terms “traditional” and “folk” may be used interchangeably to refer to those aspects of learned behavior (culture) that are transferred through word of mouth and/or by following an example set within a cultural group. Traditional art is learned from family or community members and is passed along through generations, with each artist remaining true to time-honored methods or techniques, yet free to add personal creativity to the process. Folk or traditional artists are highly trained, and it is the manner of their training that earns them the designation of folk. </p>

<p> To me it's more of the basics. Learning the primary colors. Sketches, inking, painting. Anything that is NOT not digital. Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium[1] to a solid surface (support base). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.

Painting is a mode of creative expression, and the forms are numerous. Drawing, gesture (as in gestural painting), composition, narration (as in narrative art), or abstraction (as in abstract art), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism), or political in nature (as in Artivism).

A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by spiritual motifs and ideas. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes rendered on the interior walls and ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of Eastern religious origin.

In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action. The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, clay, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, as well as objects. The term painting is also used outside of art as a common trade among craftsmen and builders.
